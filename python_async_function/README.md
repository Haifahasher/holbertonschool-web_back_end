# Python - Async Function

This project focuses on asynchronous programming in Python using asyncio, including async/await syntax, concurrent coroutines, and asyncio tasks.

## Learning Objectives

- async and await syntax
- How to execute an async program with asyncio
- How to run concurrent coroutines
- How to create asyncio tasks
- How to use the random module

## Requirements

- Python 3.9
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- pycodestyle style (version 2.5.x)
- All files must be executable
- All functions and coroutines must be type-annotated
- All modules and functions must have documentation

## Tasks

0. The basics of async
1. Let's execute multiple coroutines at the same time with async
2. Measure the runtime
3. Tasks
4. Tasks (alternate implementation)

# Python - Async Comprehension

This project focuses on asynchronous generators and comprehensions in Python, including type annotations for generators.

## Learning Objectives

- How to write an asynchronous generator
- How to use async comprehensions
- How to type-annotate generators

## Requirements

- Python 3.9
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- pycodestyle style (version 2.5.x)
- All files must be executable
- All functions and coroutines must be type-annotated
- All modules and functions must have documentation

## Tasks

0. Async Generator - Create an async generator that yields random numbers
1. Async Comprehensions - Use async comprehension to collect values from async generator
2. Run time for four parallel comprehensions - Measure runtime of parallel async operations
